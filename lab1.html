<h1 id="history">Apple History</h1>
<p>Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a business partnership.[6][9] The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[10][11] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Bus, for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for US$500 (equivalent to $2,381 in 2021).[12] Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[13][14] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal computer.[15] It went on sale soon after debut for US$666.66 (equivalent to $3,175 in 2021).[16][17][18][19][20]: 180  Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked "repeating digits".[21]

    Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[22][23] without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded Apple.[24][25] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of US$250,000 (equivalent to $1,117,930 in 2021) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.[26][27] During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.[28][29]
    
    The Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first West Coast Computer Faire.[30] It differed from its major rivals, the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color graphics and open architecture. While the Apple I and early Apple II models used ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5+1⁄4-inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II in 1978.[31][32]
    
    The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first "killer application" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program released in 1979.[31] VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office.[31] Before VisiCalc, Apple had been a distant third place competitor to Commodore and Tandy.[33][34] By the end of the 1970s, Apple had become the leading computer manufacturer in the United States.[35]
    
    On December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol "AAPL") went public selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share ($.10 per share when adjusting for stock splits as of September 3, 2022),[23] generating over $100 million, which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in 1956.[36] By the end of the day, 300 millionaires were created, from a stock price of $29 per share[37] and a market cap of $1.778 billion.[36][37]
    
    1980–1990: Success with Macintosh
    See also: Timeline of Macintosh models and Timeline of the Apple II family
    
    The Macintosh, released in 1984, is the first mass-market personal computer to feature an integral graphical user interface and mouse.
    A critical moment in the company's history came in December 1979 when Jobs and several Apple employees, including human–computer interface expert Jef Raskin, visited Xerox PARC in to see a demonstration of the Xerox Alto, a computer using a graphical user interface. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000[38] shares (22.4 million split-adjusted shares as of September 3, 2022)[23] of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.[39] After the demonstration, Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface, and development of a GUI began for the Apple Lisa, named after Jobs's daughter.[40][41]
    
    The Lisa division would be plagued by infighting, and in 1982 Jobs was pushed off the project. The Lisa launched in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price and limited software titles.[42]
    
    Jobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's Macintosh division. Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as low-cost-computer with a text-based interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.[43] Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue.[44]
    
    In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language.[45] Its debut was signified by "1984", a $1.5 million television advertisement directed by Ridley Scott that aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984.[46] This is now hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success[47] and was called a "masterpiece" by CNN[48] and one of the greatest TV advertisements of all time by TV Guide.[49][50]
    
    The advertisement created great interest in the original Macintosh, and sales were initially good, but began to taper off dramatically after the first three months as reviews started to come in. Jobs had made the decision to equip the original Macintosh with 128 kilobytes of RAM, attempting to reach a US$1,000 (equivalent to $2,608 in 2021) price point, which limited its speed and the software that could be used. The Macintosh would eventually ship for US$2,495 (equivalent to $6,508 in 2021), a price panned by critics in light of its slow performance.[51][52][53][54]: 195  In early 1985, this sales slump triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO John Sculley, who had been hired away from Pepsi two years earlier by Jobs[55][56] using the famous line, "Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?"[57] Sculley decided to remove Jobs as the head of the Macintosh division, with unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.[58][55]
    
    The board of directors instructed Sculley to contain Jobs and his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple.[59] Informed by Jean-Louis Gassée, Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a boardroom coup and called an emergency meeting at which Apple's executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties.[59] Jobs resigned from Apple in September 1985 and took a number of Apple employees with him to found NeXT.[60] Wozniak had also quit his active employment at Apple earlier in 1985 to pursue other ventures, expressing his frustration with Apple's treatment of the Apple II division and stating that the company had "been going in the wrong direction for the last five years".[44][61][62] Despite Wozniak's grievances, he officially remained employed by Apple, and to this day continues to work for the company as a representative,[61] receiving a stipend estimated to be $120,000 per year for this role.[20] Both Jobs and Wozniak remained Apple shareholders after their departures.[63]
    
    After the departures of Jobs and Wozniak, Sculley worked to improve the Macintosh in 1985 by quadrupling the RAM and introducing the LaserWriter, the first reasonably priced PostScript laser printer. PageMaker, an early desktop publishing application taking advantage of the PostScript language, was also released by Aldus Corporation in July 1985.[64] It has been suggested that the combination of Macintosh, LaserWriter and PageMaker was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.[65]
    
    This dominant position in the desktop publishing market[66] allowed the company to focus on higher price points, the so-called "high-right policy" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher profit margin, and appeared to have no effect on total sales as power users snapped up every increase in speed. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, notably due to Jean-Louis Gassée's mantra of "fifty-five or die", referring to the 55% profit margins of the Macintosh II.[67]: 79–80 
    
    This policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as desktop publishing programs appeared on PC clones that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh, but at far lower price points. The company lost its dominant position in the desktop publishing market and estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history to have declining sales, which led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.[67]: 117–129  During this period, the relationship between Sculley and Gassée deteriorated, leading Sculley to effectively demote Gassée in January 1990 by appointing Michael Spindler as the chief operating officer.[68] Gassée left the company later that year.[69]</p>
